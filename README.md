## SAGAM-Net
A Spatially Adaptive Graph Attention Memory Network for Traffic Forecasting.

## Training and testing
The full data is available at the link below, and some of the METALR data is provided here in METALR\\712. Directly run main_train_and_test.py code for speed datasets and main_train_and_test_flow.py for flow datasets, and the ‘Save’ folder contains the completed program, with log information for the training and testing.
